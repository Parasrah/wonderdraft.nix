# wonderdraft.nix

NOTE: this does not provide access to wonderdraft itself. You must provide
your own copy of the `wonderdraft.zip` available when you purchase the
software.

## How to use?

First step is to move your **legitimately aquired** copy of wonderdraft to
the root of this directory at `<repo>/wonderdraft.zip`. You can look at
[My Config](https://github.com/Parasrah/nix-config) for an example of how
to consume it.
